## Compilation notes:
* Compiled using pandoc-ebook-template. For instructions see:
	* https://github.com/evangoer/pandoc-ebook-template
* Note: pdf/latex version didn't compile last time I tried it, but I wasn't really trying to and it could easily be that I just don't have all the necessary latex dependencies installed.
* In cover and spriggan directories are .txt files describing the different files in those directories.
