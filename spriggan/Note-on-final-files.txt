# Note-on-final-files
This directory contains the draft development and final files for the story itself.


## Files in this directory:

* Tremble_the_Flowering_Wood-passive_version.wiki
	* The first complete story as initiall submitted for publication on Medium.
* Tremble_the_Flowering_Wood.wiki
	* Revised story submitted for final publication on Medium using mdium.
* Tremble_the_Flowering_Wood.md
	* Same as above, but prepped for publication on Amazon KDP.


## Note on Spriggan git:
Spriggan (Tremble) was written without the benefit of git. So this
directory does not have a git commit history up to the point of
a final .md file. It was added to a git repo when it was published as
an ebook, so the git commit history only covers that. Don't go looking
for early versions of the story in the git commit history.




## Note on posting to Literotica

Use command in tech notes for vim to combine all lines of all paragraphs.

Replace _underbars_ with html <i>tags</i>


What horrors and pleasures lie in the heart of the woods?
...PRETTY sure it's lie not lay.
