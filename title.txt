This list isn't some vast database of contacts, it's more like a friends-and-family thing. Besides, my productivity is so low, you'll probably wish to see MORE emails from me, not fewer. Consider buying another story! Just search for A. Andiron on the Kindle Store. If everyone reading this right now paid $3, I would have like $9. But it would only take 10k people paying $3 for me to make a living doing this. (Yes I could live on that.) There probably ARE 10,000 people out of the 7 billion in the world who would be willing to pay that. It could be you! And If you support my creative project, I'll support yours! send me your link.
description: There had always been the stories about that particular part of the back country. Strange glowing lights deep in the woods, large indentations in the earth that could double as footprints of some monstrosity, and the occasional disappeared person. But when her job forces a young, tough, working-class girl to venture alone into those dim woods, what she finds there is both more terrifying and pleasurable than anyone might have ever dreamed.
